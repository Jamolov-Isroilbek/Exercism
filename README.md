## Overview

75+ exercises completed, covering topics like string manipulation, data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more. Some exercises include multiple iterations showing how the solution evolved.

## Structure

Each exercise lives in its own folder. Numbered subdirectories (`1/`, `2/`, ...) represent solution iterations — later versions are refinements of earlier ones.

## Topics Covered

**Algorithms** — Binary search, Collatz conjecture, prime factors, saddle points, Luhn validation

**Data Structures** — Lists, sets, dictionaries, generators, nested data manipulation

**String Processing** — Ciphers (Atbash, rotational), run-length encoding, pig latin, word count

**Math & Logic** — Armstrong numbers, perfect numbers, Roman numerals, difference of squares

**OOP & Design** — Classes, state management, robot name generation, D&D character creation
